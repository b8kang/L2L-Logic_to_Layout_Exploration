# Logic_to_Transistor_Network_Synthesis/

Experimental artifacts from transistor-network synthesis under different **stack bounds** and **input pools**.

Each directory contains both:

- **Aggregate summaries** (`all_logs_summary.txt`)
- **Detailed synthesis logs** (`logic_*_all_topo_*.log`)

These logs record transistor-network synthesis results including:

- Enumerated transistor network topologies
- Valid implementations for Boolean functions
- Multiple optimal solutions when they exist

These results cover **P-class Boolean functions up to three inputs**.

---

## 2stack_DP/

Synthesis results with stack bound **M = 2** using **DP (Dual Polarity) input pool**.

Files include:

- `all_logs_summary.txt` ? Aggregate synthesis statistics
- `logic_1input_P_CLASS_all_topo_2staged_final_0_to_1.log`
- `logic_2input_P_CLASS_all_topo_2staged_final_0_to_7.log`
- `logic_3input_P_CLASS_all_topo_2staged_final_0_to_67.log`

---

## 2stack_Op/

Synthesis results with stack bound **M = 2** using **Op (permutation-closed input pool)**.

Files include:

- `all_logs_summary.txt`
- `logic_1input_P_CLASS_all_topo_2staged_final_0_to_1.log`
- `logic_2input_P_CLASS_all_topo_2staged_final_0_to_7.log`
- `logic_3input_P_CLASS_all_topo_2staged_final_0_to_67.log`

---

## 3stack_DP/

Synthesis results with stack bound **M = 3** using **DP input pool**.

Contains detailed synthesis logs for 1-, 2-, and 3-input P-class Boolean functions.

---

## 3stack_Op/

Synthesis results with stack bound **M = 3** using **Op input pool**.

Contains detailed synthesis logs for 1-, 2-, and 3-input P-class Boolean functions.

---

## 4stack_DP/

Synthesis results with stack bound **M = 4** using **DP input pool**.

Contains detailed synthesis logs for 1-, 2-, and 3-input P-class Boolean functions.

---

## 4stack_Op/

Synthesis results with stack bound **M = 4** using **Op input pool**.

---

## Grid_Scaffold/

- `logic_3input_P_CLASS_result_summary`

Synthesis summary for **series-parallel-only transistor network experiments**.

---

# Notes

## DP vs. Op

**DP (Dual Polarity)**  
Input pool containing both a primary input and its inversion.

**Op (Permutation-Closed Pool)**  
Input pool where permutation-equivalent input instantiations are deduplicated.

---

## Stack Bound (M)

Maximum allowed number of **series transistors** during PMOS network synthesis.

---

## CPP

Contact Poly Pitch.

CPP is used as the **fundamental unit of cell width** in layout generation.

---

## Detailed Results

This repository provides both:

- **Aggregate statistics**
- **Detailed per-function synthesis artifacts**

including multiple optimal transistor-network solutions discovered during synthesis.
